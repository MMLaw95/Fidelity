      <strong><span class="fidelity">In the 1960s,</span></strong> Fidelity was the first major American finance firm to market mutual funds directly to everyday people via direct mail advertising and door to door sales. Previously, mutual funds had been marketed almost exclusively to high-income or high-wealth individuals, retirement funds for employers, and/or those already in the finance industry.

      The company was founded as Fidelity Management & Research (FMR) by Edward C. Johnson II in 1946.

      In 1969, they formed Fidelity International Limited (FIL) to serve non-U.S. markets and subsequently spun it off in 1980 into an independent entity owned by its employees.

      In 1982, FMR company started offering 401(k) products. In 1984, it offered computerized stock trading.

      <strong><span class="fidelity">In April 2022,</span></strong> Fidelity Investments announced that they would offer Bitcoin as an investment option, specifically in its 401(k) plans by the middle of the year. It is also the first major 401(k) provider to offer cryptocurrency as an investment for retirement savers, according to CNN. However, this option will only be offered to participants whose employers have elected to include it in their plan, as of now.
